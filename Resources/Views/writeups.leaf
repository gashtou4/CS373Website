<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>
    This is a blog for Oregon State University's CS 373 (Defense Against the Dark Arts). Here I will talk about what I learned in each week's videos. Some of this I may have already known but I want this to be a place where others can learn as well. Below are links to each weeks write ups. As I complete write ups for each week, the links will appear below. If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please head over to the <a href="/Contact">contact page</a>.
