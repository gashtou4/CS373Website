Week 2 Write Up
</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Topic: Advanced Forensics</h2>

<h3>Introduction: </h3>
This week we get into advanced forensic techniques. The purpose is to identify, preserve, analyze
and present digital evidence in manner that is legally acceptable. Basically it is the process of
unearthing data of value from information systems.
So when do we actually conduct forensic investigations?
<ul>
<li>Fraud</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Theft</li>
<li>Hacker Intrusions / Data Breaches</li>
<li>Inappropriate Use of the Internet</li>
<li>Child Exploitation</li>
<li>eDiscovery Support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process: </h3>
The steps of Forensics are
<ol>
<li>Evidence Acquisition</li>
<li>Investigation and Analysis</li>
<li>Report Results</li>
</ol><br/>
There are three basic categories for forensics: Live Forensics, Post-Mortem Based Forensics, and Network Based Forensics.
It is NOT up to us to prove if a suspect is guilty or not. We are only proving what happened on the system. That is all!
Forensics in a nutshell includes the following aspects:
<ul>
<li>Identify Evidence</li>
<li>Preserve Evidence</li>
<li>Analyze Evidence</li>
<li>Present Results</li>
</ul><br/>
These need to be done while following the appropriate standards, especially when the results need to be admitted by a court
of law. The four main principles that you must always adhear to are:
<ul>
<li>Minimize data lose</li>
<li>Record Everything</li>
<li>Analyze all data collected</li>
<li>Report your findings</li>
</ul><br/>
What is evidence? Evidence is anything that you can use to prove or disprove a fact. Evidence can be found at the following layers:
<ul>
<li>Network (Firewall, IDS, routers)</li>
<li>Operating System</li>
<li>Databases and Applications</li>
<li>Peripherals</li>
<li>Removable media (CD/DVD, USB, ...)</li>
<li>Human Testimony (of course)</li>
</ul><br/>
Triage is the process of proving the same conclusion mutliple different ways. For example, getting the same story from the
Registry, Sys Log files, Sql-Log files, and others. Evidence is admissible if a court considers it legitimate. Preserving the
integrity of the evidence at all times is extremely important! You can ensure this the following way:
<ol>
<li>Create a cryptographic hash of the entire disk and partition</li>
<li>Create bit-image copy of each disk and analyze them</li>
<li>Create a cryptograhic hash of the copy and ensure the hash value match</li>
<li>Lock the original disk in a limited-access room or container</li>
</ol><br/>

Below is a picture of the full Incident Response Process from the note: <br/>

<br/>
Generally, having an incident response team is a luxury. Most teams are created adhoc consisting of subject matter experts.



<h3>APT-Kill Chain: </h3>
<p>Below is a picture of the APT-Kill Chain.</p>

<br/>
Generally, the first alert will come from the Installation Step or the the Command and Control Step. Sometimes, the alert
could come from the Delivery step due to a spam filter catching it. Once the alert has come through, you can begin looking for
evidence from the other steps. There are some difficulties which can be the amount of data, synchronizing the timeline,
the number of skills needed, the sheer number of tools needed, and log formats are different. <br/><br/>
The Investigation cycle is: Verification -> System Description -> Evidence Acquisition. There is also the following cycle<br/>
Timeline Analysis -> Media Analysis -> String or Byte Search -> Data Recovery -> Reporting Analysis -> Timeline Analysis.

<h3>Important Ideas:</h3>
<p>Locard's Exchange Principle states that when any two objects come into contact, there is ALWAYS a transference of
material from each object onto the other. You cannot interact with a live system without having some effect on it! While
investigating a live system, ALWAYS make sure you write down everything since you are making changes to the system with
every action you preform. Always remember: "Once contaminated - Stay contaimnated = Compromised evidence".</p>
<p>On you initial response do not, I repeat, DO NOT pull the plug and shut the machine down. Very critical evidence can be
destroyed but turning off the system. Attackers are begining to take advantage of the volatile storage media in a system.
The level to which one can hide data relies on the level of access to the system and the technical competency of the attacker.
Sometimes it can be a good idea to pull the network cord or block ports on the router.</p>
<p>When collecting evidence, always proceed from most volatile to least volatile:
<ul>
<li>System Memory</li>
<li>Temporary File systems (swapfile / paging file)</li>
<li>Process Table & Network Connections</li>
<li>Network Routing information and ARP cache</li>
</ul><br/>
At this point, live forensics ends, and the machine can be powered down and moved if necessary.
<ul>
<li>Forensics Acquisition of Disks</li>
<li>Remote Loggings and Monitoring data</li>
<li>Physical config & Network topology</li>
<li>Backups</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>FTK Imager:</h3>
<p>FTK Imager is tool that allows you to dump the memory of the system (along with other things). When dumping the memory
of the system, always store it on external media or on a network share. Never store it on the suspect machine. When dumping
the memory, always give it a descriptive name. You can use a project name, serial numbers, and date to ensure it is
descriptive. With this tool you can also copy out protected files as well (such as the Master File Table "MFT")!
Running the GUI version of this tool has a bigger impact on the system as opposed to the command line version.
With FTK Imager you can add evidence items from different sources like physical drives, logical drive (Raid 5 for example),
image files, and contents of a folder. When cloning drives, make sure to use a descriptive name here as well! This tool
can do many other things that I won't cover in this write up but can be found with quick searches on the internet.
</p>

<h3>Physical Memory (RAM):</h3>
<p> RAM is the short-term memory of a computer. The information decays very rapidly as soon asthe module is disconnected from
power or clock sources. There have been recent studies that have shown it isn't as rapid as we first thought though.<br/>
There is a vast amount of inormation in RAM that only exists when the applications are running. Much of this cannot be
found on the harddrive. You can often find atrifacts that were hidden by the attacker while analyzing the RAM. Below is a
list of some contents that can be found in memory.
<ul>
<li>All running processes at the time of the dump</li>
<li>All loaded modules and DLLs including injected malware</li>
<li>All running device drivers (including potential rootkits</li>
<li>All open files (and their paths) for each process</li>
<li>All open registry keys for each process</li>
<li>All open network sockets for each process (including IP and Port info)</li>
<li>Decrpyted version of otherwise encrypted info</li>
<li>Keystrokes</li>
<li>Encryption Keys & Passwords</li>
<li>And much, much more</li>
</ul><br/>
Volatility is a tool that helps us preform Advanced Memory Forensics on a memory dump.  There are tons of plugins to Use
along with being able to create your own! A few examples of useful plugins are:
<ul>
<li>Malfind: detects hidden and injected code</li>
<li>Csrpslit: dtected hidden processes with crss.exe handles and ScrRoot-Process Links</li>
<li>Orphan threads</li>
<li>PSList: shows process based on a linked lists</li>
</ul><br/>
The lab on Volatility was eye opening and really made me admire all that the tool can do!

<h3>Advanced Windows Forensics</h3>
<p>
Virtually everything done in Windows refers to or is recorded in the registry. As an example, every time a USB stick
is inserted into the sytem, the fingerprint of the specific USB stick is recorded in the registry. The registry consists of 5
hierarchal folders called 'hives' and begin with 'HKEY' (<b>H</b>andle to a <b>KEY</b>). Although 5 can be seen, only two
of them are actually there. The other three are just shortcuts to folders within those two. The two actual folders are
HKEY_USERS(HKU) and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE(HKLM). Each of these hives is composed of keys which contain values and subkeys.
Values are the names of certain items within a key which uniquely identify specific values pertaining to the OS,
or to applications that depend on that value. You can use the registry to help create a timeline of the events that happened
on the machine. Volatility can help create timelines using the timeliner plugin.
</p>

<h3>Data Recovery</h3>
<p>
This is also called Data Carving. This is the process of recovering files or data that were deleted or in slack
from the system. When a file is deleted, all that is removed is the file start and file end flags. The actual data between
them isn't deleted or overwritten at that time. PhotoRec is an app that tries to carve out files in an image based on headers
and footers.
